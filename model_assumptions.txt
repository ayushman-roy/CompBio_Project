=============================

1. Population Structure
----------------------

  - 40-59 years: 250,000 people (25%)
  - 60+ years: 200,000 people (20%)

2. Disease Dynamics
------------------
- Viral load follows a three-phase pattern:
  * Incubation (0-3 days): L(t) = L₀ * exp(αt), α = 0.5, L₀ = 0.1
  * Peak (3-8 days): L(t) = L_max, L_max = 1.0
  * Decline (8+ days): L(t) = L_max * exp(-δ(t - t_peak)), δ = 0.1, t_peak = 8
- Transmission rate depends on:
  * Base transmission rate (beta = 0.3)
  * Contact rates between age groups

  IFR = D/(I + Q + R + D)
- Years of Life Lost (YLL):
  YLL = Σ(D_i * (LE - age_midpoint_i)), LE = 80 years
