Model Assumptions and Parameters
=============================

1. Population Structure
----------------------
- Population divided into 4 age groups:
  * 0-19 years (Children/Teens)
  * 20-39 years (Young Adults)
  * 40-59 years (Middle Age)
  * 60+ years (Elderly)
- Each age group has different:
  * Susceptibility to infection
  * Recovery rates
  * Vaccine effectiveness
  * Base mortality rates
  * Viral load sensitivity

2. Disease Dynamics
------------------
- Viral load follows a three-phase pattern:
  * Incubation (0-3 days): L(t) = L₀ * exp(αt), α = 0.5, L₀ = 0.1
  * Peak (3-8 days): L(t) = L_max, L_max = 1.0
  * Decline (8+ days): L(t) = L_max * exp(-δ(t - t_peak)), δ = 0.1, t_peak = 8
- Transmission rate depends on:
  * Base transmission rate (beta = 0.3)
  * Contact rates between age groups
  * Viral load level
  * Age-specific susceptibility

3. Intervention Parameters
-------------------------
- Quarantine rates (theta):
  * Baseline: 0.05
  * High: 0.40
  * Extreme: 0.60
- Vaccination rates (nu):
  * Baseline: 0.01
  * High: 0.10
  * Extreme: 0.10

4. Age Group Parameters
----------------------
- 0-19 years:
  * Susceptibility: 0.8
  * Recovery rate: 1.2
  * Vaccine effectiveness: 0.7
  * Population fraction: 0.25
  * Mortality rate: 0.0002
  * Viral load sensitivity: 1.2
- 20-39 years:
  * Susceptibility: 1.0
  * Recovery rate: 1.0
  * Vaccine effectiveness: 0.8
  * Population fraction: 0.30
  * Mortality rate: 0.001
  * Viral load sensitivity: 1.8
- 40-59 years:
  * Susceptibility: 1.2
  * Recovery rate: 0.9
  * Vaccine effectiveness: 0.85
  * Population fraction: 0.25
  * Mortality rate: 0.005
  * Viral load sensitivity: 2.5
- 60+ years:
  * Susceptibility: 1.5
  * Recovery rate: 0.7
  * Vaccine effectiveness: 0.9
  * Population fraction: 0.20
  * Mortality rate: 0.02
  * Viral load sensitivity: 3.5

5. Contact Patterns
------------------
- Contact matrix represents average daily contacts:
  [3.0, 1.5, 0.5, 0.2]  # Children/Teens
  [1.5, 2.0, 1.0, 0.3]  # Young Adults
  [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 0.5]  # Middle Age
  [0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0]  # Elderly

6. Model Limitations
-------------------
- Assumes homogeneous mixing within age groups
- Does not account for:
  * Healthcare capacity constraints
  * Seasonal variations
  * Geographic distribution
  * Comorbidities
  * Long-term effects
  * Reinfection
  * Waning immunity

7. Simulation Parameters
-----------------------
- Time horizon: 180 days
- Time steps: 1000 points
- Numerical integration:
  * Relative tolerance: 1e-6
  * Absolute tolerance: 1e-6
- Initial conditions:
  * 99% susceptible
  * 1% infected
  * Initial viral load: 0.1

8. Analysis Metrics
------------------
- Basic Reproduction Number (R₀):
  R₀ = β/γ * (1 - θ/(γ + θ + μ))
- Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR):
  IFR = D/(I + Q + R + D)
- Years of Life Lost (YLL):
  YLL = Σ(D_i * (LE - age_midpoint_i)), LE = 80 years
- Peak Healthcare Demand:
  peak_demand = max(I + Q)

9. Output Analysis
-----------------
- Tracks:
  * Cumulative deaths by age group
  * Daily death rates
  * Viral load impact on mortality
  * Case fatality rates
  * Peak daily deaths
  * Average viral loads
- Generates:
  * Time series plots
  * Scatter plots
  * Bar charts
  * JSON analysis files
  * Comparison visualizations
