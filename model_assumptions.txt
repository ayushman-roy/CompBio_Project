Model Assumptions and Parameters
=============================

1. Population Structure
----------------------
- Population divided into 4 age groups:
  * 0-19 years (Children/Teens)
  * 20-39 years (Young Adults)
  * 40-59 years (Middle Age)
  * 60+ years (Elderly)
- Each age group has different:
  * Susceptibility to infection
  * Recovery rates
  * Vaccine effectiveness
  * Base mortality rates
  * Viral load sensitivity

2. Disease Dynamics
------------------
- Viral load follows a three-phase pattern:
  * Incubation (0-3 days): Slow exponential growth
  * Peak (3-8 days): Maximum viral load
  * Decline (8+ days): Exponential decay
- Transmission rate depends on:
  * Base transmission rate (beta)
  * Contact rates between age groups
  * Viral load level
  * Age-specific susceptibility

3. Intervention Parameters
-------------------------
- Quarantine rate (theta): 0.05
  * Fraction of infected individuals isolated
  * Reduces transmission but increases mortality risk
- Vaccination rate (nu): 0.002
  * Rate at which susceptible individuals are vaccinated
  * Effectiveness varies by age group

4. Mortality Dynamics
--------------------
- Mortality depends on:
  * Age group
  * Viral load level
  * Time since infection
  * Quarantine status
- Base mortality rates by age:
  * 0-19: 0.0001
  * 20-39: 0.0005
  * 40-59: 0.002
  * 60+: 0.01
- Viral load sensitivity multipliers:
  * 0-19: 1.0
  * 20-39: 1.5
  * 40-59: 2.0
  * 60+: 3.0

5. Contact Patterns
------------------
- Contact matrix represents average daily contacts:
  * Higher within age groups
  * Children have more contacts
  * Elderly have fewer contacts
  * Inter-generational contacts are asymmetric

6. Model Limitations
-------------------
- Assumes homogeneous mixing within age groups
- Does not account for:
  * Healthcare capacity constraints
  * Seasonal variations
  * Geographic distribution
  * Comorbidities
  * Long-term effects
  * Reinfection
  * Waning immunity

7. Simulation Parameters
-----------------------
- Time horizon: 180 days
- Time step: 0.18 days (1000 points)
- Initial conditions:
  * 99% susceptible
  * 1% infected
  * Initial viral load: 0.1

8. Output Analysis
-----------------
- Tracks:
  * Cumulative deaths by age group
  * Daily death rates
  * Viral load impact on mortality
  * Case fatality rates
  * Peak daily deaths
  * Average viral loads
- Generates:
  * Time series plots
  * Scatter plots
  * Bar charts
  * Text analysis files
